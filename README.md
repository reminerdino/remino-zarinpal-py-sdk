# Zarinpal Python SDK Documentation

## **Introduction**

The **Zarinpal Python SDK** provides an easy and flexible way to interact with Zarinpal’s payment gateway APIs. With features like payment initiation, transaction management, refunds, and reversals, it helps streamline integration with Zarinpal’s platform in both live and sandbox environments.

---

## **Installation**

### **Requirements**:  
- Python >= 3.12

### **Install**:

**From PyPI**:
```bash
pip install zarinpal-py-sdk

From TestPyPI (for testing purposes):

pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ zarinpal-py-sdk
```

### **Features**:

1. Manage Payments

Easily initiate and verify payments using secure APIs.

Example:

payment = zarinpal.payment_gateway.create({  
    "amount": 10000,  
    "description": "Order #1234",  
    "callback_url": "https://example.com/callback",  
})

2. Transaction Management

Fetch transaction details with filters, limits, and pagination using GraphQL.

Example:

transactions = zarinpal.transactions.list({  
    "terminal_id": "YourTerminalID",  
    "filter": "PAID",  
    "limit": 10,  
    "offset": 0,  
})

3. Refunds & Reversals

Easily process refunds or reverse a transaction with a single API call.

Example - Refund:

refund = zarinpal.refunds.create({  
    "session_id": "Session1234",  
    "amount": 5000,  
    "description": "Refund for Order #1234",  
    "reason": "CUSTOMER_REQUEST",  
})

Example - Reversal:

response = zarinpal.reversals.reverse({  
    "authority": "AUTHORITY_CODE",  
})

4. Sandbox Support

Easily switch between sandbox and live environments for development and production.

How to Use

5. Initialize SDK

from zarinpal import ZarinPal  
from utils.Config import Config  

config = Config(  
    access_token="YourAccessToken",  
    merchant_id="YourMerchantId"
    sandbox=True,  # Use sandbox environment  
)  
zarinpal = ZarinPal(config)  

Full Example: Fetching Transactions

from zarinpal import ZarinPal  
from utils.Config import Config  

def get_transactions():  
    try:  
        config = Config(  
            access_token="YourAccessToken",  
        )  
        zarinpal = ZarinPal(config)  

        transactions = zarinpal.transactions.list({  
            "terminal_id": "YourTerminalID",  
            "filter": "PAID",  
            "limit": 10,  
            "offset": 0,  
        })  

        print("Transactions List:", transactions)  
    except Exception as e:  
        print("Error fetching transactions:", e)  

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    get_transactions()
